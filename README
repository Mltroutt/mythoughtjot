Defaults:

    To load default data run 'python manage.py loaddata mythoughtjot_fixtures.json

    This will give you 4 default users:
        (username:password)
        admin:admin -- Default admin
        aUser:password  -- Simple user
        aUser2:password -- Simple user
        aUser3:password -- Simple user

    This will also load in one default project/canvas/node that can be viewed at 127.0.0.1:8000/canvas/1/
        The default node is not displayed, but there are default nodes on the canvas.

        The owner of this canvas is aUser -- this currently has no significance
        The collaborators on this canvas are:
            aUser,
            aUser2,
            admin

        At this point only collaborators can view the canvas if it is set to private, but anyone who is logged
            in can view the canvas if it is set to public. The default canvas is set to public by default.
